#SaaSsy Cloud

[Live Demo Site](https://www.saassycloud.com/)

##Summary
An in-progress demo project written with PHP 7.1, Laravel 5.5, and Bootstrap 4 beta 2. 

## Theme
The project uses a whimsical theme of a fictional SaaS company, SaaSsy Cloud, that markets extra power ups in the Super Mario Brothers World, as if it were a real place. It merely provides a comparison of product packages and a way for customers to sign up for a free trial. However, baked into the signup is a complete tracking system of all http requests with a focus on conversions. It also features automated assignment of a sticky A/B view group that demonstrate how one could use this technique to maximize visitor conversions.

## Architecture
This project demonstrates the use of a robust data model, using elements of Domain Driven Design(DDD) and implemented in Laravel's Eloquent Active Record based ORM.

## Technology Demonstations
In addition to using all of the latest features of Bootstrap 4 beta, the project demonstrates several features of Laravel including custom middleware, dependency injection via Service Container binding of repositories using interfaces, and every type of Eloquent relationship.

## What's Next
This is in progress, and an admin dashboard that visualizes the conversion data written in Vue.js will be the next major feature added, as an example implementation of a modern javascript framework.

## Incomplete Features
There are several missing features including:
* An actual developed onboarding page
* The provisioning of a new subdomain for each customer signup

## Motivation
I possess extensive full stack development experience, however, as all of my work over the past seven+ years is owned by my former employer, I felt I needed a demonstration project to be able to serve as a point of discussion for potential new employers.

## Notes
* This was the first project that I used bootstrap and laravel.  
** They were both very simple to pickup with my background of engineering and authoring robust front end and back end frameworks of my own.
* This will be the first project I have ever used Vue.js.
** Because I have been writing complex one page javascript applications for over a decade, using pojos and then later on jQuery, I do not expect the learning curve to be high
